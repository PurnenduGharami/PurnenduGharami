<h3 align="center">Trying to be a Game Developer & Problem Solver</h3>

## 🛑 Urgent Help Needed
I recently received my provisional letter from my dream university abroad.
I’m from Bangladesh, and this opportunity means everything to me.
My family had saved enough, but my father lost most of it in a financial scam.
Now, I’m making one last attempt to raise funds online. Since most fundraising sites don’t work here, I’m using Patreon.

I know raising $6000 in 7 days is nearly impossible — but I still want to try.
More details are on my Patreon.

If you believe in impossible dreams, please consider supporting:

## 🧠 About Me

I’m Purnendu Gharami, 18 this year, from a small town in Bangladesh. I have a unique perspective on life, and I try to reflect that through my projects.

I plan to solve real-world problems in my own way, and bring dreams to life through game development. I believe no one is truly special — but we are all **unique**, and that uniqueness can offer **new ways to solve problems**.

I don't think that if I fail to solve a problem, it will remain unsolved. Someone else surely will. But my version will always be different — and maybe that’s what makes it valuable.

Join me in my journey to become a better problem solver and a great game developer.
